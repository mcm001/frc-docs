FalconLibrary
=============

Overview
--------

Falcon Library is the backend library that is used on all FRC Team 5190
robots. This library was written in the Kotlin JVM Language. Some
features of this library include:

-  Wrapped WPILib Commands and Subsystems with Kotlin Coroutines
   asynchronous optimzation.

-  High level mathematics for path generation, tracking, custom typesafe
   units of measure, etc.

   -  Two-dimensional parametric and functional splines.
   -  Arc length of parametric quintic hermite splines evaluated using
      recursive arc subdivision (from Team 254).
   -  Trajectory generation that respects constraints (i.e.Â centripetal
      acceleration, motor voltage).
   -  Custom trajectory followers

      -  Ramsete
      -  Adaptive Pure Pursuit
      -  Feedforward

   -  Typesafe units of measure

      -  Quick and easy conversions between all length, velocity,
         acceleration, electrical units.
      -  Support for Talon SRX native unit length and rotation models.

-  AHRS sensor wrapper for Pigeon IMU and NavX.

-  Tank Drive Subsystem abstraction with built-in odometry and command
   to follow trajectories.

-  Talon SRX wrapper that utilizes Kotlin properties to set
   configurations.

-  Custom robot base with fully implemented state machine and coroutine
   support.

-  Other WPILib wrappers for NetworkTables, etc.

Java Interoperability
-----------------------

FalconLibrary is written in Kotlin, a new programming language based
on the Java Virtual Machine. Kotlin code is fully interoperable with
Java code. One caviat: static functions and members will be split
into their own file, seperate file. For instance, to construct a Java
Length, one would do:

   var x = LengthKt.getFeet(10);

Contributing
------------

This library is open source and we would love to have you contribute
code to this repository. Please make sure that before submitting a pull
request, your code is formatted according to ``ktlint`` (already in the
project). The Gradle build will fail if all code is not formatted
correctly.

To format code automatically, run ``./gradlew spotlessApply``. Please
build the project locally using ``./gradlew build`` to make sure
everything works before submitting a pull request.

When adding new features, it is encouraged that these features be
game-agnostic. This library is intended to be used for robots that play
any game. Also make sure to include unit-tests for any new features.
