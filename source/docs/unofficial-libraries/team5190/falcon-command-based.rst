FalconLibrary's Command-based Implememntation
======================================================

FalconLibrary implements a Command Based framework, similar
to WPILib. Java teams are reccomended to just use WPI's Command-
based. Please note that to use FalconLibrary's built-in
tank-drive drivetrains a team will have to be completely
Falcon-command-based, and teams using WPI's command-based
cannot use any FalconCommands or FalconSubsystems.
